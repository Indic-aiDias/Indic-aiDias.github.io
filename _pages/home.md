### About Indic AiDias

Indic AIDias is an independent, 501(c)3 non-profit organization with a mission to make machine learning (ML) research opportunities, including collaboration and mentorship opportunities **accessible** and **free** for all.

Indic AIDias is a community for the genuinely curious people who are interested in getting better at doing machine learning research, for whatever reason. To that end, the community building aspect of Indic is creating a place to 1) develop and train relevant skills for maturing into a researcher, 2) find kindred spirits, friends and collaborators along the way, 3) produce serious research, and 4) give back to society.

Indic can be a "research home" for you regardless of your affiliation, employer, or background.
